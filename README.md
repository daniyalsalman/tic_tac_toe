# tic_tac_toe

After learning basics of JavaScript like arrays,loops and different fundamental functions like forEach and DOM alongside events i built a tic tac toe game for putting my knowledge to use. I even used some CSS but just enough to help my project go to completion and nothing out of the box.

Tools and Technologies:
CSS
HTML
JS 
VS Code 

Do feel free to make changes and ping me on any blunders i've made.
